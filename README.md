# Email Signature Generator

This is a quick tool I built that will generate a email signature based on input of a yaml file.
## Usage
1. Grab the latest binary for your Operating Systm from [here](https://github.com/JamesAtTensure/emailSigGenerator/releases)
2. Extract it into its own folder
3. Edit `emailSigGenerator.yaml` and populate the fields
4. run `emailSigGenerator`
5. You can then copy the signature to your email client of choice.
